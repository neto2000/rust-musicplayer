# Idea
 A lightweight terminal Music Player written in Rust.

 - You can shuffle a playlist
 - a playlist is just a folder with mp3 files
 - high visual customization with config files
 - ? Display album cover
 - implemented audiogram
 - ? play youtube songs (maybe impossible) ?

# ToDo's
 - [x] implement shuffle playlist
 - [ ] only display .mp3 files
 - [ ] remove extension on display
 - [ ] create extra frame with play/pause, timeline, etc. (only visual)
 - [ ] config file and access to it

 - [ ] **Play MP3**
  - [ ] find rust crate (rodio)
  - [ ] play/pause
  - [ ] get timeline
  - [ ] skip songs
 
 - [ ] **Audiogram**
