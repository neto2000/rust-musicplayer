# Idea
 A lightweight terminal Music Player written in Rust.

 - You can shuffle a playlist
 - a playlist is just a folder with mp3 files
 - high visual customization with config files
 - ? Display album cover
 - implemented audiogram
 - ? play youtube songs (maybe impossible) ?

# ToDo's
 - [x] implement shuffle playlist
 - [x] only display .mp3 files
 - [x] remove extension on display
 - [x] create extra frame with play/pause, timeline, etc. (only visual)
 - [x] display song info

 - [x] select song and play it with "p"


 ### Bugs
  - [ ] playlist goes out of bounds
  - [ ] very high cpu usage while playing song

 ### UI
  - [ ] selected line: highlight whole line
  - [ ] alternating highlight colors for whole playlist


 - [ ] **Config File**


 - [ ] **Audiogram**
  - [ ] ? audiogram maybe above timeline ?
